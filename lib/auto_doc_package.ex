defmodule AutoDocPackage do

  The package "AutoDocPackage" is used by the "Auto Doc" microservice
  for generating API documentation based on OpenApiSpex format for Elixir projects.

  This package handles the transmission of data
  between the `AutoDoc` microservice and your Elixir project.
  It also generates the API Documentation directories and files filled with data,
  nested inside the respected `/documentation` directory.

  ## Prerequisites
  The package requires `:jason` and `:httpoison` to run while your project requires `:open_api_spex` as a documentation tool.

  - Dependencies:
    - `[:jason](https://hexdocs.pm/jason/Jason.html)`
    - `[:httpoison](https://hexdocs.pm/httpoison/HTTPoison.html)`

  ## Installation
