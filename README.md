# Installation
Add the following dependencies to `mix.exs` file `deps/0` function.

Note: We'll need `Jason` and `HTTPoison` to format the data and do the API calls.

```elixir
{:jason, "~> 1.2"},
{:httpoison, "~> 2.0"},
{:auto_doc_package, git: "https://github.com/zen-dev-lab/auto_doc_package"}
```

# Registration
1. Go to [auto-doc.fly.dev](https://auto-doc.fly.dev/)
2. Click _**Sign in**_
3. Register via Github OAuth
4. Being forwarded to your _**dashboard**_ page where a personal user `token` can be seen(important for later)

![Register via Github](https://github.com/zen-dev-lab/auto_doc_package/assets/49829807/ef0db07f-c992-4581-ab12-46275b50b26c)

# Personal Github Access Token
For Authorizing API calls to _**Auto Doc**_, you'll need a personal access token.
1. Navigate to `settings/tokens` page [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta)
2. Click _**Generate new token**_
3. Give it some name and set your expiration date to 90 days or more
4. Click _**Generate token**_
5. Copy your personal access token (important in for the next step)

![Github access token](https://github.com/zen-dev-lab/auto_doc_package/assets/49829807/79f594af-9359-462f-b196-2ed386075cfe)

# Setup ENV Variables
In your `.env` file, add the following ENV Variables:
```env
# The Token shown in your Dashboard
export AUTO_DOC_USER_TOKEN="your-user-token-here"
# The Github Access Token we just created in the previous step
export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-access-token-here"
```

To apply the changes done to the file, run the following command in your IDE terminal:
```shell
source .env
```

That's it! You can now use the package and API. ðŸ™Œ

# AutoDocPackage usage
* First, start your **Interactive Elixir shell** by running the following command in your IDE's terminal
  ```shell
  iex -S mix
  ```
* Then, we need to pick the documentation directory and the controller to create OpenApiSpex docs for.
* Copy the relative paths to both the _directory_ and _the controller file_ and assign them to variables.
  ```shell
  documentation_path = "example/lib/example_web/documentation"
  controller_path = "example/lib/example_web/controllers/page_controller.ex"
  ```
  
  ![copy relative paths](https://github.com/zen-dev-lab/auto_doc_package/assets/49829807/d97ad914-26c0-470e-ab7a-5448dfd88cf9)
  
* Now, execute the function written below
  ```shell
  AutoDocPackage.Requests.gen_example_data_file(documentation_path, controller_path)
  ```
* Notice that under the `lib/` directory a new file with the name `example_data.json` has been created.
  ![example_file generated](https://github.com/zen-dev-lab/auto_doc_package/assets/49829807/7efdf0e9-05ce-40e4-9cef-095c732d369a)
* Open it and check its content.
  ![example_data filecontent](https://github.com/zen-dev-lab/auto_doc_package/assets/49829807/20f522d5-f074-4ae3-9b59-a1093536b2ae)
* It contains two types of keys:
  * _special keys_(start and end with `__`) which musn't be edited.

    ![special keys](https://github.com/zen-dev-lab/auto_doc_package/assets/49829807/3fa1f427-3cab-4d6c-a93e-ca6716d5b3aa)
  * _operation keys_(each key corresponds to a new undocumented action in your controller)

    ![operation keys](https://github.com/zen-dev-lab/auto_doc_package/assets/49829807/3243948c-e9b4-4b71-a566-96cdfc0bb47a)
* With the `example_data.json` file present, what's left to do is add the params/response payloads for each action key
and then run the `gen_api_spex/1` commmand with the corresponding argument.
  * There are three possible arguments for that command
    * `:params` or `"params"` -> states that params payloads have been passed and should create the new Params modules 
    * `:response` or `"response"` -> states that response payloads have been passed and should create the new Response modules
    * `:operations` or `"operations"` ->  states that the new Params/Response modules have been created and should add the new operation functions (and their aliases)
  * Generate **response** modules
    * Pass the response payloads as described earlier and run
      ```shell
      AutoDocPackage.Requests.gen_api_spex(:response)
      ```
      ![response payloads in example_data](https://github.com/zen-dev-lab/auto_doc_package/assets/49829807/c2744026-6345-46c6-b843-dce275895dd2)

    * Then, your `response.ex` file will be generated or the new modules will be appended to the existing file.

  * Generate **params** modules:
    * Same as the previous step but you pass the params payloads and run the command with `:params` argument
      ```shell
      AutoDocPackage.Requests.gen_api_spex(:params)
      ```
      ![params payload in example_data](https://github.com/zen-dev-lab/auto_doc_package/assets/49829807/04890892-96dc-4df0-b4ee-d1a22d63879a)
 
    * **Important!** -> For actions which don't have params payload(such as `GET` requests), then remove the respective keys from the `example_data.json` file to avoid unnecessary Params modules generation.
      This behaviour is shown in the example image(`show` and `index` keys have been removed). 
  * Generate operations module/functions:
    * After completing the previous two steps, simply run
      ```shell
       AutoDocPackage.Requests.gen_api_spex(:operations)
      ```
      ![Operations module](https://github.com/zen-dev-lab/auto_doc_package/assets/49829807/5dff9ec5-4dbf-4a91-9037-4e7a00a60edb)

    * You'll notice that the new operations functions have been added to the end of your `operations.ex` file's `Operations` module and the params/response aliases have also been included.
    * Default `errors/` directory will be created in the root of your `documentation/` dir. It'll contain a default error file handling status `401`.

      ![not authenticated error file](https://github.com/zen-dev-lab/auto_doc_package/assets/49829807/dfbcb521-6362-4c24-9658-ef5f30ce12ab)

    * If you don't have `errors.ex` file present, a default one will be generated to handle statuses `404` and `422` which are aliased and used in the **Operations** module.
      If the file exists, nothing will happen, meaning that the content will not be overwritten. 

      ![default errors file](https://github.com/zen-dev-lab/auto_doc_package/assets/49829807/e838bb68-db70-48ab-84ab-b9fd12896d13)

    * You're done! Your OpenApiSpex Documentation is completed (excluding any missing fields and description writing)
   
  * Important!
    * Use as detailed payloads as possible since they're the most important part of types/values generation and mapping.
      Anything missing in the payload in return will be missing in the generated documentation. 
    * Descriptions are still written manually and for that case, search for the `TOWRITE` keyword and change all occurences with your custom text.
      
      ![towrite example](https://github.com/zen-dev-lab/auto_doc_package/assets/49829807/6fbd8227-bbb8-4b53-9455-ed057bf9f42d)

    * If a type wasn't recognized upon generation, it'll have value of `:unknown` and should be changed to the proper value manually.
    
      ![type unknown](https://github.com/zen-dev-lab/auto_doc_package/assets/49829807/c88ff841-3a43-4d02-9d17-ed3c5f92da91)

      
    * In params payload, if one of the main keys matches the model(schema)'s field name, its `default` and `values` will be mapped and also be added to the API Docs automatically.
